I realized that the nature of the images (i.e the q) were long long strings of one bit (0 or 1) and then another long string of another bit. Hence, I figured the solution would be some way to combine the rows of the same bit into one method of storage. This way the row of 50 zeros wouldn't have to be encoded seperately, it could just be 0 and then 50 stored. |
| November 29th | 9:15pm - 9:45 pm | I decided to start tackling how to store( the rows/runs of bits, especially because storing 50/runlength) might take up more space/storage than simply storing the value at hand. Then i realized I could just maximize runlength at 1 byte (256) ensuring that it doesn't get out of hand. Once the runlength reached that amount, or the bit changed (from a 0 to one) the run length could be written out, and then it would be restarted at 1, with the next bit saved as the new current bit. I'm not sure if this is space efficient enough to get a 30% compression-- but as of now I can't really think of a quicker way to implement it. |

I will be working on that after todays class, to test my solution-- and then see if it works and what changes i need to make.  |
